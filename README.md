Tracking your daily Health Habits and essential Medicines as per the prescribed Schedule.

What's the problem?
Most people often forget to take their medicines at regular intervals or to keep track of their health parameters.It becomes really useful if an app takes care of all those things for us.It really keeps us up to date with the schedule and takes care of our health.

How can this project help?
Health tracker App will send notifications at regular intervals so that the user does not forget to take their prescribed medicines as per the schedule, also keep track of their essential information.

The idea
The idea is to integrate the Flutter App with SQLite Backend where we will store all the user's data in a secured and organized way.
